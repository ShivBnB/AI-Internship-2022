Project Description

Problem:
Attendance is manually recorded in numerous locations, including offices, schools, etc. 
People must be manually marked as absent or present after being manually verified by one person. 
It takes a while to complete this.

Solution:

Making an automated attendance system that can identify people through facial recognition and designate them as present is the answer to this problem. 
A camera will capture a picture of the student, employee, etc. 
at the start of the day, and face recognition software will then be used to identify who the person is.
Once acknowledged, they are noted as present.

How can AI be used?

The ability to detect faces, determine who they are, and then label them as present will require artificial intelligence. 
The dataset for the AI will consist of pictures and names of a particular group of individuals, 
and it will need to be trained to be able to identify an individual from the dataset when they appear in another image.
